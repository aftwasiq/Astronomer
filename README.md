Astronomer is a discord bot that allows you to peer into the skies and gain information on any celestial object; star, galaxy, or planet. You can also look at NASAs photo of the day, asteroids passing Earth, space-related news, and much more.

Push **$astronomy_help** on a discord chat that Astronomer has access to, in order to begin configuration or see a list of already-available commands to use. As of 2023/03/06, Astronomer is currently used in 10+ Discord Servers.

Astronomers features are limited at the moment, and many more are to come as I improve the bot further. This is the first (proper) Discord Bot I've made, which utilizes web-scraping, and integration of NASA Open APIs, Wikipedia Public APIs, and News APIs to fetch and display dynamic content related to celestial objects, space news, and astronomy.

Here are examples usages of current commands that Astronomer has:
